# SIGs and Working Groups

Most community activity is organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs),
time bounded Working Groups, and the [community meeting](communication.md#Meeting).

SIGs follow these [guidelines](governance.md) although each of these groups may operate a little differently
depending on their needs and workflow.

Each group's material is in its subdirectory in this project.

When the need arises, a [new SIG can be created](sig-creation-procedure.md)
